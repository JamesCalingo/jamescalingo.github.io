          <p>
            For as long as I can remember, I've been working with computers.
            Whether it was writing stories and papers in Word, playing with
            sounds in Garageband, or even just surfing the internet, I spent
            countless hours each day at the computer.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day, while browsing around the internet in search of a new
            career path, I found web development through a coding bootcamp. I
            quickly fell in love with the problem solving nature of it and the
            feeling of making code work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I'm working on dynamic applications, learning new things every
            day, and trying to keep up with the busy world of software
            development/engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, I have a background in Psychology (with a Bachelors Degree), was involved in a church band for over ten years (including four as one of its coordinators), spent a year running a church's livestream on Sunday mornings, and am an avid collector of sports jerseys.
